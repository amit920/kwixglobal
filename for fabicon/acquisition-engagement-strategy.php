           App analytics and performance attribution is of paramount importance. After investing funds and efforts in creating a mobile app, wouldn’t you want quick return on your investment? Won’t you like answers to questions like…where are most of your app users coming from? What motivates them to stay longer? Where and why are they bouncing off? What if you get hard numbers to such vital questions at every app development stage? Using app marketing analytics and creating a sound acquisition engagement strategy help measure what’s working in retaining and converting users and what isn’t. This is key factor that differentiates successful apps from others.
