            Wireframing is one of the crucial steps in design process because it allows you to completely
craft the information hierarchy of the app design, thus making it easier to plan the whole layout
as per the user’s needs. Wireframe tools make the process easy and help in knowing how to
design an app or website flawlessly and making it fundamentally easier at the same time. In the
initial phase itself, inorder to make your clients understand the complete project and how it will
work, Wireframes are the best method. Wireframe tools can be extremely helpful in that circle.
