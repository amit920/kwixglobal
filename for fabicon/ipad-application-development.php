							<h3>Delivering Polished and User-centric Apps Destined for iOS Environment</h3>
							<p >Apple's all the launches have seen success, and with the iPad selling approx. 26 million units in the first quarter of 2014 has added to its success rate. The sleeker design, user focused features, and alluring Retina screen - are the factors that have made iPad, one of the most needed and adopted Apple's inventions that have provided best-in-class user experience.
							However, it's been an assumption that any iPhone app can work on iPad too, just because they share the same operating system. But, the reality is entirely different. Though, iPad environment allows to run iPhone apps on iPad, but the reality is that designing and developing an app meant for the iPad needs extreme caution and concern for the iPad platform alone. Building user-centric apps for iPad not just needs kink-free coding and flawless design expertise for iPad environment but also a top-notch mobile development company that has in-depth understanding of developing apps for larger screens. Many app developers and designers make a common assumption that the iPad is just a "bigger" iPhone, but the reality is much more different and complex. </p>
