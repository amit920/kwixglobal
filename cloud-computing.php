              <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
              <p>
                Cloud-based applications — or software as a service — run on distant computers “in the cloud” that are owned and operated by others and that connect to users’ computers via the internet and, usually, a web browser.
              </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

              <h3>Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>
              <p>
                Platform as a service provides a cloud-based environment with everything required to support the complete lifecycle of building and delivering web-based (cloud) applications — without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware, software, provisioning, and hosting.

              <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
              <p>
                Infrastructure as a service provides companies with computing resources including servers, networking, storage, and data center space on a pay-per-use basis.

              <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
              <p>
                Public clouds are owned and operated by companies that offer rapid access over a public network to affordable computing resources. With public cloud services, users don’t need to purchase hardware, software, or supporting infrastructure, which is owned and managed by providers.
             </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

              <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
              <p>
               A private cloud is infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally. Private clouds can take advantage of cloud’s efficiencies, while providing more control of resources and steering clear of multi-tenancy.

          <div class="solutin_pack">
              <h3>Hybrid Cloud

</h3>
              <p>
               A hybrid cloud uses a private cloud foundation combined with the strategic integration and use of public cloud services. A private cloud can’t exist in isolation from the rest of a company’s IT resources and the public cloud. Most companies with private clouds will evolve to manage workloads across data centers, private clouds, and public clouds - thereby creating hybrid clouds.
